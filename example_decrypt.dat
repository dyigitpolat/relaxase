The National University of Singapore (NUS) is the national research university of Singapore. Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

The department of Computer Science offers two undergraduate degree programmes – Computer Science and Information Security, while the department of Information Systems and Analytics offers the other two - Information Systems and Business Analytics.[35]DentistryThe Faculty of Dentistry had its early beginnings in 1929 as a Department of Dentistry within the King Edward VII College of Medicine.[36] The faculty conducts a four-year dental course leading to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. The undergraduate programme comprises two pre-clinical (first two years) and two clinical years. The Faculty of Dentistry is organised into five academic departments covering the disciplines of Oral Sciences; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; Endodontics, Operative Dentistry and Prosthodontics; Periodontics; and Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry.Duke–NUS Medical SchoolMain article: Duke–NUS Medical SchoolThe Duke–NUS Medical School is a collaboration between Duke University in North Carolina, United States and the National University of Singapore.[37]EngineeringThe Faculty of Engineering was launched in 1968. It is the largest faculty in the university and consists of several divisions/departments: Biomedical Engineering; Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering; Civil & Environmental Engineering; Electrical & Computer Engineering; Engineering Science Programme; Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM); Materials Science & Engineering; and Mechanical Engineering. The Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM), resulting from a merger between the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Division of Engineering & Technology Management, is similar in structure and research focus to the Department of Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) at Stanford University.The NUS Faculty of Engineering was ranked 6th in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities for Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences.[38] It has also been ranked 7th in the world in the subject category of Engineering and Technology by the 2017 QS World University Subject Rankings[39] and 2016-2017 Times Higher Education World University Subject Rankings.[40]Integrative Sciences and EngineeringNUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS) was established in 2003. The principal purpose of NGS is "to promote integrative PhD research encompassing both laboratory work and coursework programmes which not only transcend traditional subject boundaries but also provides students with a depth of experience about science and the way it is carried out".[41]NGS' PhD programmes are firmly anchored in cross-disciplinary research. It offers a spectrum of research areas spanning science, engineering, related aspects of medicine, and interactive & digital media. NGS also offers the following PhD degree programmes.[42]Joint NUS-Karolinska PhD ProgrammeNUS PhD-MBALawMain article: NUS Faculty of LawThe NUS Faculty of Law was first established as a Department of Law in the then University of Malaya in 1956. The first law students were admitted to the Bukit Timah campus of the university the following year. In 1977, the faculty shifted to the Kent Ridge campus, but in 2006 it relocated back to the Bukit Timah site.Apart from the traditional LLB which runs for four years, the law school also offers double honours degrees in Business Administration & Law, Economics & Law,[43] Law & Life Sciences,[44] and a concurrent degree programme in Law & Public Policy.[45] For graduate students, the law school offers coursework LLM specialisations[46] in areas such as Corporate and Financial Services Law, Intellectual Property & Technology Law, International & Comparative Law, Maritime Law and Asian Legal Studies.MedicineThe Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS was first established as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School in 1905.

For Nursing, the Bachelor of Science (Nursing) conducted by the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies is offered. The department also offers postgraduate Master of Nursing, Master of Science (Nursing) and Doctor of Philosophy programmes.MusicThe Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (YSTCM) is a collaboration between NUS and the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University. Singapore's first conservatory of music, YSTCM was founded as the Singapore Conservatory of Music in 2001. The School was renamed Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music in recognition of a gift from the family of the late Dr Yong Loo Lin in memory of his daughter.[citation needed]Public HealthThe Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health is Singapore's first and only tertiary education institution for public health.[47] It traces its beginnings to the University of Malaya's Department of Social Medicine and Public Health, formed in 1948.[48] The school collaborates with partners including the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Harvard School of Public Health and University of Michigan School of Public Health.[47]Public PolicyMain article: Lee Kuan Yew School of Public PolicyThe Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy was formally established in 2004 as an autonomous graduate school of NUS. Although the School was formally launched in 2004, it inherited NUS' Public Policy Programme, which was established in 1992 in partnership with Harvard University's John F Kennedy School of Government.ScienceThe Faculty of Science comprises the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Food Science & Technology, Mathematics, Pharmacy, Physics, and Statistics & Applied Probability and offers degree programmes in Chemistry, Computational Biology, Data Science & Analytics, Environmental Studies (Environmental Biology), Food Science & Technology, Life Sciences, Mathematics/Applied Mathematics, Pharmaceutical Science, Pharmacy, Physics, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics. The first female Dean of the Faculty of Science was Gloria Lim, who was appointed in 1973. She served a four-year term and was reappointed in 1979, but resigned after one year to allow Koh Lip Lin to continue his post. In 1980, University of Singapore merged with Nanyang University to form NUS, resulting in overlapping posts.[49]University Scholars ProgrammeThe University Scholars Programme (USP) is an undergraduate academic programme established in 2001 in NUS. Each year, USP admits around 200 undergraduates from across seven faculties and schools in NUS.The USP education focuses on strengthening core academic and professional skills – writing and critical thinking, analytical and quantitative reasoning, the ability to ask the right questions and pursue research, and the habit of reflecting upon ideas within a broad intellectual landscape. This is done through an intensive and rigorous multi-disciplinary curriculum, and a rich offering of local and international programmes. USP's focus on core skills complements the students' strengths in their major disciplines, enabling them to make substantial connections across fields, enhancing their intellectual depth and breadth.USP students reside in Cinnamon College at the NUS University Town. Alongside a vibrant student life, the residential college is a space for discussions on diverse issues, allowing students to develop meaningful engagement with real-world matters.Yale-NUS CollegeMain article: Yale-NUS CollegeThe Yale-NUS College is a liberal arts college in Singapore which opened in August 2013 as a joint project of Yale University and the National University of Singapore. It exists as an autonomous college within NUS, allowing it greater freedom to develop its own policies while tapping on the existing facilities and resources of the main university.[50] Students who graduate receive a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) or a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree from Yale-NUS College awarded by NUS.[50]Pericles Lewis, a former professor at Yale, was appointed as the founding president in 2012.[51][52][53][54]Teaching centresNUS High School of Mathematics and Science CampusNUS has a variety of teaching centres including:Centre for Development of Teaching and Learning (CDTL), which is the NUS academic development unit and in that capacity seeks to support teaching so as to improve student learning.Centre for Instructional Technology (CIT), which provides for the exploration, development and application of digital and audio-visual technologies to support and enhance teaching and learning.

Initiatives in this area include bioimaging, tissue engineering and tissue modulation. Another new field which holds much promise is nanoscience and nanotechnology. Apart from higher-performance but lower-maintenance materials for manufacturing, defence, transportation, space and environmental applications, this field also heralds the development of accelerated biotechnical applications in medicine, health care and agriculture.[citation needed]Research institutes and centresCurrently, NUS hosts 21 university-level research institutes and centres (RICs) in various fields such as research on Asia, risk management, logistics, engineering sciences, mathematical sciences, biomedical and life sciences, nanotechnology to marine studies. Besides that, NUS also hosts three Research Centres of Excellence, namely, the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Centre for Quantum Technologies and Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore – a partner in Singapore's fifth Research Centre of Excellence. Besides university-level RICs, NUS also has close affiliation with many national research centres and institutes.[56] A special mention is required for The Logistics Institute – Asia Pacific, which is a collaborative effort between NUS and the Georgia Institute of Technology for research and education programmes in logistics.[57] NUS announced its most recent research institute, the Next Age Institute, a partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, in February 2015.[58]Major research facilitiesComparative Medicine was set up to provide professional and technical service for laboratory animal care, veterinary medical services, and animal research project support for NUS staff and students.National University Medical Institutes focuses its efforts on the development of centralised research facilities and services for the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS and developing research programmes in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.[60]EntrepreneurshipNUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NUS Enterprise is the entrepreneurial arm of NUS. Its activities are organised into 4 areas, including a business incubator,[61] entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurship outreach and technology commercialisation.The NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme was started in 2001, giving students the opportunity to experience, live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub. Participants of the programme either spend 6 months or a year overseas, taking courses at partner universities and working in start-ups.[62] The program is offered at twelve different locations: Silicon Valley and New York in the United States, Toronto in Canada, Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China, Stockholm in Sweden, Munich in Germany, Lausanne in Switzerland, Israel, Singapore and Southeast Asia (Jakarta and Vietnam).The NUS Industry Liaison Office (ILO) is another department that is involved in the creation of deep tech start-ups. It manages the University's technology transfer and promotes research collaborations with industry and partners. ILO manages NUS intellectual property, commercialises its intellectual assets and facilitates the spinning off of technologies into start-up companies.[63]Campus facilities and resourcesIT and computing servicesThe IT facilities and network are generally provided by its central IT department, Computer Centre. NUSNET is used in research, teaching, learning and administration. In 2004, a campus-wide grid computing network based on UD Grid MP was deployed, connecting at least 1,000 computers. This becomes one of the largest such virtual supercomputing facilities in the region.[64]NUS used Internet2 technology to make distance learning possible. Students from Singapore and Massachusetts Institute of Technology were able to learn and interact in one virtual classroom.[65]Library servicesThe NUS Libraries comprises 8 libraries, namely, the Central Library, Chinese Library, CJ Koh Law Library, Hon Sui Sen Memorial Library, the Medical Library, Music Library, Science Library and East Asian Institute Library. Its primary clients are NUS and NUS-affiliated research institutes, students, teaching faculty, research and administrative staff members, as well as a sizeable group of external members.

As of June 2017, there are 2,354,741 unique titles, and 26,074 microform resources[66] in the collection.[67]NUS University TownThe NUS University Town (UTown) opened in August 2011. Located across the NUS Kent Ridge campus, it was built on the site of a former golf course.[68] This is where 2,400 undergraduate students, 1,700 graduate students and 1,000 researchers work, live, and learn in close proximity. There are four residential colleges: Cinnamon College, Tembusu College, College of Alice & Peter Tan, and Residential College 4 – initially named Cinnamon, Tembusu, Angsana and Khaya, respectively. An Education Resource Centre, the Stephen Riady Centre and a Graduate Residence are also located here.[69]AccessibilityThere are several internal shuttle buses that run throughout NUS: A1, A2, D1, D2, B1, B2, C, BTC1, BTC2, A1E, A2E, and AV1. Information on bus routes can be found in the NUS NextBus app. The Kent Ridge campus can be accessed by taking a shuttle bus from the Kent Ridge MRT station (CC24). The Bukit Timah campus is located close to the Botanic Gardens MRT station (CC19).Student accommodationNUS has three types of student accommodation: Halls of residence; Student residences; and Residential colleges. There are about 6,000 residential places distributed between Halls of Residence and Student Residences on campus, in addition to around 4,100 students who live in the residential colleges and graduate residences at University Town.[70] There are free Internal Shuttle Buses that ply the entire campus seven days a week.[71]Halls of residenceNUS has 7 Halls of Residence with about 3,000 residential places. Halls have their own interest groups and regular student productions, in addition to university-wide student co-curricular activities. Halls compete with each other in the Inter-Hall Games.The Halls of Residence are:[72]Eusoff Hall (345 single rooms; 70 double rooms)Kent Ridge Hall (507 single)King Edward VII Hall (350 single; 60 double)Raffles Hall (213 single; 128 double)Sheares Hall (509 single)Temasek Hall (345 single; 70 double)Prince George's Park House (626 single)Student residencesNUS also has 3 Student Residences for undergraduate students with clusters of 11 to 15 single rooms with their own kitchen and bathroom facilities. Kitchen and dining areas are equipped with basic cooking appliances. The NUS University Town houses the Graduate Residence for graduate students with the option of both apartments and single rooms.[73] Residences generally do not have co-curricular activities.The Student Residences are:[74]Kuok Foundation HousePrince George's Park ResidencesGraduate ResidencesResidential collegesThe more recent residential developments at NUS are residential colleges, modeled after the residential college systems of universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. Like halls, residential colleges have unique co-curricular activities. Residential colleges also have their own academic programmes, with general education (GE) requirements different from each other and from the rest of the University. The academic programmes in residential colleges take place in small-sized seminar classes.Cinnamon CollegeCinnamon College houses the University Scholars Programme (USP). Around 620 students live in the USP residential college, which contains the administrative and faculty offices for USP as well as teaching classrooms.USP students take modules at the college and follow the current USP curriculum. They are required to take eight multi-disciplinary modules specially designed for USP students, including Writing and Critical Thinking, Quantitative Reasoning Foundation, and the University Scholars Seminar. Students have various options to fulfil their USP advanced curriculum requirements that include individual research with faculty mentors, and industrial and entrepreneurial attachments.[75]Tembusu CollegeTembusu College is one of the first two Residential Colleges in NUS University Town, an extension to the main NUS campus at Kent Ridge. Tembusu houses mainly undergraduates, in addition to resident faculty, distinguished visiting scholars and a few graduate fellows.The college offers five multi-disciplinary modules fulfilling the "University-Level Requirements" (2 General Education modules, 2 Breadth modules, and 1 Singapore Studies module) which most NUS undergraduates must read to graduate. Students read the rest of their modules in their home faculties. A University Town Residential Programme Certificate is issued to eligible students, along with the regular degree scroll. Students from non-modular faculties (i.e. Law, Medicine and Dentistry) also belong to the college, but with coursework tailored to their specific programmes.[citation needed] The Rector of Tembusu College is Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large and former United Nations Ambassador Tommy Koh, who is also the former Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law.College of Alice & Peter TanThe College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) is a Residential College for all NUS undergraduates. In addition to providing a two-year academic programme (the University Town College Programme), CAPT is distinguished by the vision of helping students engage with the community within and outside of NUS. It consciously weaves the theme of active citizenship and community engagement through its curriculum and other aspects of the student experience.Residential College 4Residential College 4 (RC4) is the newest Residential College in NUS University Town to offer the University Town College Programme (UTCP). RC4 believes in catalysing a generation of systems citizens in Singapore by employing systems thinking and systems dynamic modelling to elicit mental models to emulate the complexity of the problems around us – such as population dynamics, diseases and healthcare.Recent events and highlights of RC4 included the holding of the 2nd Asia-Pacific System Dynamics Conference 2017, RC4 Arts Night 2017: P.U.L.S.E, Cognitio Teas with various experts of varying fields, Rector's Tea, as well as volunteering events such as Popiah Making with Senior Citizens @ Lions Befrienders (Clementi) and DroneLive@UTown. More information about the college can be found at NUS RC4Ridge View Residential CollegeRidge View Residential College (RVRC) was formally established in April 2014, housed in the former Ridge View Residences. It is the only residential college that is situated outside University Town. The low-rise interconnected buildings are nestled against the backdrop of the Kent Ridge Forest, visually distinct with their brick-clad exteriors, open courtyards and heritage trees. The site was the former location for Kent Ridge Hall until November 2002. As the college program gradually evolved and the student community grew, construction began in November 2015 for a new building to complement the needs of the college. The new Annex building became operational in March 2017.List of principal officersThe following table is a list of the principal officers of the National University of Singapore's predecessors.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

Apart from higher-performance but lower-maintenance materials for manufacturing, defence, transportation, space and environmental applications, this field also heralds the development of accelerated biotechnical applications in medicine, health care and agriculture.[citation needed]Research institutes and centresCurrently, NUS hosts 21 university-level research institutes and centres (RICs) in various fields such as research on Asia, risk management, logistics, engineering sciences, mathematical sciences, biomedical and life sciences, nanotechnology to marine studies. Besides that, NUS also hosts three Research Centres of Excellence, namely, the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Centre for Quantum Technologies and Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore – a partner in Singapore's fifth Research Centre of Excellence. Besides university-level RICs, NUS also has close affiliation with many national research centres and institutes.[56] A special mention is required for The Logistics Institute – Asia Pacific, which is a collaborative effort between NUS and the Georgia Institute of Technology for research and education programmes in logistics.[57] NUS announced its most recent research institute, the Next Age Institute, a partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, in February 2015.[58]Major research facilitiesComparative Medicine was set up to provide professional and technical service for laboratory animal care, veterinary medical services, and animal research project support for NUS staff and students.National University Medical Institutes focuses its efforts on the development of centralised research facilities and services for the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS and developing research programmes in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.[60]EntrepreneurshipNUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NUS Enterprise is the entrepreneurial arm of NUS. Its activities are organised into 4 areas, including a business incubator,[61] entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurship outreach and technology commercialisation.The NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme was started in 2001, giving students the opportunity to experience, live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub. Participants of the programme either spend 6 months or a year overseas, taking courses at partner universities and working in start-ups.[62] The program is offered at twelve different locations: Silicon Valley and New York in the United States, Toronto in Canada, Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China, Stockholm in Sweden, Munich in Germany, Lausanne in Switzerland, Israel, Singapore and Southeast Asia (Jakarta and Vietnam).The NUS Industry Liaison Office (ILO) is another department that is involved in the creation of deep tech start-ups. It manages the University's technology transfer and promotes research collaborations with industry and partners. ILO manages NUS intellectual property, commercialises its intellectual assets and facilitates the spinning off of technologies into start-up companies.[63]Campus facilities and resourcesIT and computing servicesThe IT facilities and network are generally provided by its central IT department, Computer Centre. NUSNET is used in research, teaching, learning and administration. In 2004, a campus-wide grid computing network based on UD Grid MP was deployed, connecting at least 1,000 computers. This becomes one of the largest such virtual supercomputing facilities in the region.[64]NUS used Internet2 technology to make distance learning possible. Students from Singapore and Massachusetts Institute of Technology were able to learn and interact in one virtual classroom.[65]Library servicesThe NUS Libraries comprises 8 libraries, namely, the Central Library, Chinese Library, CJ Koh Law Library, Hon Sui Sen Memorial Library, the Medical Library, Music Library, Science Library and East Asian Institute Library. Its primary clients are NUS and NUS-affiliated research institutes, students, teaching faculty, research and administrative staff members, as well as a sizeable group of external members. Its collection encompasses subjects in architecture, building and real estate, business, dentistry, engineering, computer science, the humanities and social sciences, law, medicine, music, nursing and science. As of June 2017, there are 2,354,741 unique titles, and 26,074 microform resources[66] in the collection.[67]NUS University TownThe NUS University Town (UTown) opened in August 2011. Located across the NUS Kent Ridge campus, it was built on the site of a former golf course.[68] This is where 2,400 undergraduate students, 1,700 graduate students and 1,000 researchers work, live, and learn in close proximity. There are four residential colleges: Cinnamon College, Tembusu College, College of Alice & Peter Tan, and Residential College 4 – initially named Cinnamon, Tembusu, Angsana and Khaya, respectively. An Education Resource Centre, the Stephen Riady Centre and a Graduate Residence are also located here.[69]AccessibilityThere are several internal shuttle buses that run throughout NUS: A1, A2, D1, D2, B1, B2, C, BTC1, BTC2, A1E, A2E, and AV1. Information on bus routes can be found in the NUS NextBus app. The Kent Ridge campus can be accessed by taking a shuttle bus from the Kent Ridge MRT station (CC24). The Bukit Timah campus is located close to the Botanic Gardens MRT station (CC19).Student accommodationNUS has three types of student accommodation: Halls of residence; Student residences; and Residential colleges. There are about 6,000 residential places distributed between Halls of Residence and Student Residences on campus, in addition to around 4,100 students who live in the residential colleges and graduate residences at University Town.[70] There are free Internal Shuttle Buses that ply the entire campus seven days a week.[71]Halls of residenceNUS has 7 Halls of Residence with about 3,000 residential places. Halls have their own interest groups and regular student productions, in addition to university-wide student co-curricular activities. Halls compete with each other in the Inter-Hall Games.The Halls of Residence are:[72]Eusoff Hall (345 single rooms; 70 double rooms)Kent Ridge Hall (507 single)King Edward VII Hall (350 single; 60 double)Raffles Hall (213 single; 128 double)Sheares Hall (509 single)Temasek Hall (345 single; 70 double)Prince George's Park House (626 single)Student residencesNUS also has 3 Student Residences for undergraduate students with clusters of 11 to 15 single rooms with their own kitchen and bathroom facilities. Kitchen and dining areas are equipped with basic cooking appliances. The NUS University Town houses the Graduate Residence for graduate students with the option of both apartments and single rooms.[73] Residences generally do not have co-curricular activities.The Student Residences are:[74]Kuok Foundation HousePrince George's Park ResidencesGraduate ResidencesResidential collegesThe more recent residential developments at NUS are residential colleges, modeled after the residential college systems of universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. Like halls, residential colleges have unique co-curricular activities. Residential colleges also have their own academic programmes, with general education (GE) requirements different from each other and from the rest of the University. The academic programmes in residential colleges take place in small-sized seminar classes.Cinnamon CollegeCinnamon College houses the University Scholars Programme (USP). Around 620 students live in the USP residential college, which contains the administrative and faculty offices for USP as well as teaching classrooms.USP students take modules at the college and follow the current USP curriculum. They are required to take eight multi-disciplinary modules specially designed for USP students, including Writing and Critical Thinking, Quantitative Reasoning Foundation, and the University Scholars Seminar. Students have various options to fulfil their USP advanced curriculum requirements that include individual research with faculty mentors, and industrial and entrepreneurial attachments.[75]Tembusu CollegeTembusu College is one of the first two Residential Colleges in NUS University Town, an extension to the main NUS campus at Kent Ridge. Tembusu houses mainly undergraduates, in addition to resident faculty, distinguished visiting scholars and a few graduate fellows.The college offers five multi-disciplinary modules fulfilling the "University-Level Requirements" (2 General Education modules, 2 Breadth modules, and 1 Singapore Studies module) which most NUS undergraduates must read to graduate. Students read the rest of their modules in their home faculties. A University Town Residential Programme Certificate is issued to eligible students, along with the regular degree scroll. Students from non-modular faculties (i.e. Law, Medicine and Dentistry) also belong to the college, but with coursework tailored to their specific programmes.[citation needed] The Rector of Tembusu College is Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large and former United Nations Ambassador Tommy Koh, who is also the former Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law.College of Alice & Peter TanThe College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) is a Residential College for all NUS undergraduates. In addition to providing a two-year academic programme (the University Town College Programme), CAPT is distinguished by the vision of helping students engage with the community within and outside of NUS. It consciously weaves the theme of active citizenship and community engagement through its curriculum and other aspects of the student experience.Residential College 4Residential College 4 (RC4) is the newest Residential College in NUS University Town to offer the University Town College Programme (UTCP). RC4 believes in catalysing a generation of systems citizens in Singapore by employing systems thinking and systems dynamic modelling to elicit mental models to emulate the complexity of the problems around us – such as population dynamics, diseases and healthcare.Recent events and highlights of RC4 included the holding of the 2nd Asia-Pacific System Dynamics Conference 2017, RC4 Arts Night 2017: P.U.L.S.E, Cognitio Teas with various experts of varying fields, Rector's Tea, as well as volunteering events such as Popiah Making with Senior Citizens @ Lions Befrienders (Clementi) and DroneLive@UTown. More information about the college can be found at NUS RC4Ridge View Residential CollegeRidge View Residential College (RVRC) was formally established in April 2014, housed in the former Ridge View Residences. It is the only residential college that is situated outside University Town. The low-rise interconnected buildings are nestled against the backdrop of the Kent Ridge Forest, visually distinct with their brick-clad exteriors, open courtyards and heritage trees. The site was the former location for Kent Ridge Hall until November 2002. As the college program gradually evolved and the student community grew, construction began in November 2015 for a new building to complement the needs of the college. The new Annex building became operational in March 2017.List of principal officersThe following table is a list of the principal officers of the National University of Singapore's predecessors. Note that the office of the President of Raffles College was renamed Principal of Raffles College from 1938.[76]AlumniFor a more comprehensive list, see List of National University of Singapore people.Since its inception in 1905, NUS has had many distinguished alumni, including 4 Singaporean Prime Ministers and Presidents, 2 Malaysian Prime Ministers, politicians, judiciaries, business executives, educators and local celebrities.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

The department of Computer Science offers two undergraduate degree programmes – Computer Science and Information Security, while the department of Information Systems and Analytics offers the other two - Information Systems and Business Analytics.[35]DentistryThe Faculty of Dentistry had its early beginnings in 1929 as a Department of Dentistry within the King Edward VII College of Medicine.[36] The faculty conducts a four-year dental course leading to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. The undergraduate programme comprises two pre-clinical (first two years) and two clinical years. The Faculty of Dentistry is organised into five academic departments covering the disciplines of Oral Sciences; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; Endodontics, Operative Dentistry and Prosthodontics; Periodontics; and Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry.Duke–NUS Medical SchoolMain article: Duke–NUS Medical SchoolThe Duke–NUS Medical School is a collaboration between Duke University in North Carolina, United States and the National University of Singapore.[37]EngineeringThe Faculty of Engineering was launched in 1968. It is the largest faculty in the university and consists of several divisions/departments: Biomedical Engineering; Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering; Civil & Environmental Engineering; Electrical & Computer Engineering; Engineering Science Programme; Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM); Materials Science & Engineering; and Mechanical Engineering. The Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM), resulting from a merger between the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Division of Engineering & Technology Management, is similar in structure and research focus to the Department of Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) at Stanford University.The NUS Faculty of Engineering was ranked 6th in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities for Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences.[38] It has also been ranked 7th in the world in the subject category of Engineering and Technology by the 2017 QS World University Subject Rankings[39] and 2016-2017 Times Higher Education World University Subject Rankings.[40]Integrative Sciences and EngineeringNUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS) was established in 2003. The principal purpose of NGS is "to promote integrative PhD research encompassing both laboratory work and coursework programmes which not only transcend traditional subject boundaries but also provides students with a depth of experience about science and the way it is carried out".[41]NGS' PhD programmes are firmly anchored in cross-disciplinary research. It offers a spectrum of research areas spanning science, engineering, related aspects of medicine, and interactive & digital media. NGS also offers the following PhD degree programmes.[42]Joint NUS-Karolinska PhD ProgrammeNUS PhD-MBALawMain article: NUS Faculty of LawThe NUS Faculty of Law was first established as a Department of Law in the then University of Malaya in 1956. The first law students were admitted to the Bukit Timah campus of the university the following year. In 1977, the faculty shifted to the Kent Ridge campus, but in 2006 it relocated back to the Bukit Timah site.Apart from the traditional LLB which runs for four years, the law school also offers double honours degrees in Business Administration & Law, Economics & Law,[43] Law & Life Sciences,[44] and a concurrent degree programme in Law & Public Policy.[45] For graduate students, the law school offers coursework LLM specialisations[46] in areas such as Corporate and Financial Services Law, Intellectual Property & Technology Law, International & Comparative Law, Maritime Law and Asian Legal Studies.MedicineThe Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS was first established as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School in 1905.

The NUS University Town houses the Graduate Residence for graduate students with the option of both apartments and single rooms.[73] Residences generally do not have co-curricular activities.The Student Residences are:[74]Kuok Foundation HousePrince George's Park ResidencesGraduate ResidencesResidential collegesThe more recent residential developments at NUS are residential colleges, modeled after the residential college systems of universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. Like halls, residential colleges have unique co-curricular activities. Residential colleges also have their own academic programmes, with general education (GE) requirements different from each other and from the rest of the University. The academic programmes in residential colleges take place in small-sized seminar classes.Cinnamon CollegeCinnamon College houses the University Scholars Programme (USP). Around 620 students live in the USP residential college, which contains the administrative and faculty offices for USP as well as teaching classrooms.USP students take modules at the college and follow the current USP curriculum. They are required to take eight multi-disciplinary modules specially designed for USP students, including Writing and Critical Thinking, Quantitative Reasoning Foundation, and the University Scholars Seminar. Students have various options to fulfil their USP advanced curriculum requirements that include individual research with faculty mentors, and industrial and entrepreneurial attachments.[75]Tembusu CollegeTembusu College is one of the first two Residential Colleges in NUS University Town, an extension to the main NUS campus at Kent Ridge. Tembusu houses mainly undergraduates, in addition to resident faculty, distinguished visiting scholars and a few graduate fellows.The college offers five multi-disciplinary modules fulfilling the "University-Level Requirements" (2 General Education modules, 2 Breadth modules, and 1 Singapore Studies module) which most NUS undergraduates must read to graduate. Students read the rest of their modules in their home faculties. A University Town Residential Programme Certificate is issued to eligible students, along with the regular degree scroll. Students from non-modular faculties (i.e. Law, Medicine and Dentistry) also belong to the college, but with coursework tailored to their specific programmes.[citation needed] The Rector of Tembusu College is Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large and former United Nations Ambassador Tommy Koh, who is also the former Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law.College of Alice & Peter TanThe College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) is a Residential College for all NUS undergraduates. In addition to providing a two-year academic programme (the University Town College Programme), CAPT is distinguished by the vision of helping students engage with the community within and outside of NUS. It consciously weaves the theme of active citizenship and community engagement through its curriculum and other aspects of the student experience.Residential College 4Residential College 4 (RC4) is the newest Residential College in NUS University Town to offer the University Town College Programme (UTCP). RC4 believes in catalysing a generation of systems citizens in Singapore by employing systems thinking and systems dynamic modelling to elicit mental models to emulate the complexity of the problems around us – such as population dynamics, diseases and healthcare.Recent events and highlights of RC4 included the holding of the 2nd Asia-Pacific System Dynamics Conference 2017, RC4 Arts Night 2017: P.U.L.S.E, Cognitio Teas with various experts of varying fields, Rector's Tea, as well as volunteering events such as Popiah Making with Senior Citizens @ Lions Befrienders (Clementi) and DroneLive@UTown. More information about the college can be found at NUS RC4Ridge View Residential CollegeRidge View Residential College (RVRC) was formally established in April 2014, housed in the former Ridge View Residences. It is the only residential college that is situated outside University Town. The low-rise interconnected buildings are nestled against the backdrop of the Kent Ridge Forest, visually distinct with their brick-clad exteriors, open courtyards and heritage trees. The site was the former location for Kent Ridge Hall until November 2002. As the college program gradually evolved and the student community grew, construction began in November 2015 for a new building to complement the needs of the college. The new Annex building became operational in March 2017.List of principal officersThe following table is a list of the principal officers of the National University of Singapore's predecessors. Note that the office of the President of Raffles College was renamed Principal of Raffles College from 1938.[76]AlumniFor a more comprehensive list, see List of National University of Singapore people.Since its inception in 1905, NUS has had many distinguished alumni, including 4 Singaporean Prime Ministers and Presidents, 2 Malaysian Prime Ministers, politicians, judiciaries, business executives, educators and local celebrities.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

The department of Computer Science offers two undergraduate degree programmes – Computer Science and Information Security, while the department of Information Systems and Analytics offers the other two - Information Systems and Business Analytics.[35]DentistryThe Faculty of Dentistry had its early beginnings in 1929 as a Department of Dentistry within the King Edward VII College of Medicine.[36] The faculty conducts a four-year dental course leading to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. The undergraduate programme comprises two pre-clinical (first two years) and two clinical years. The Faculty of Dentistry is organised into five academic departments covering the disciplines of Oral Sciences; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; Endodontics, Operative Dentistry and Prosthodontics; Periodontics; and Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry.Duke–NUS Medical SchoolMain article: Duke–NUS Medical SchoolThe Duke–NUS Medical School is a collaboration between Duke University in North Carolina, United States and the National University of Singapore.[37]EngineeringThe Faculty of Engineering was launched in 1968. It is the largest faculty in the university and consists of several divisions/departments: Biomedical Engineering; Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering; Civil & Environmental Engineering; Electrical & Computer Engineering; Engineering Science Programme; Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM); Materials Science & Engineering; and Mechanical Engineering. The Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM), resulting from a merger between the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Division of Engineering & Technology Management, is similar in structure and research focus to the Department of Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) at Stanford University.The NUS Faculty of Engineering was ranked 6th in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities for Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences.[38] It has also been ranked 7th in the world in the subject category of Engineering and Technology by the 2017 QS World University Subject Rankings[39] and 2016-2017 Times Higher Education World University Subject Rankings.[40]Integrative Sciences and EngineeringNUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS) was established in 2003. The principal purpose of NGS is "to promote integrative PhD research encompassing both laboratory work and coursework programmes which not only transcend traditional subject boundaries but also provides students with a depth of experience about science and the way it is carried out".[41]NGS' PhD programmes are firmly anchored in cross-disciplinary research. It offers a spectrum of research areas spanning science, engineering, related aspects of medicine, and interactive & digital media. NGS also offers the following PhD degree programmes.[42]Joint NUS-Karolinska PhD ProgrammeNUS PhD-MBALawMain article: NUS Faculty of LawThe NUS Faculty of Law was first established as a Department of Law in the then University of Malaya in 1956. The first law students were admitted to the Bukit Timah campus of the university the following year. In 1977, the faculty shifted to the Kent Ridge campus, but in 2006 it relocated back to the Bukit Timah site.Apart from the traditional LLB which runs for four years, the law school also offers double honours degrees in Business Administration & Law, Economics & Law,[43] Law & Life Sciences,[44] and a concurrent degree programme in Law & Public Policy.[45] For graduate students, the law school offers coursework LLM specialisations[46] in areas such as Corporate and Financial Services Law, Intellectual Property & Technology Law, International & Comparative Law, Maritime Law and Asian Legal Studies.MedicineThe Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS was first established as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School in 1905.

For Nursing, the Bachelor of Science (Nursing) conducted by the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies is offered. The department also offers postgraduate Master of Nursing, Master of Science (Nursing) and Doctor of Philosophy programmes.MusicThe Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (YSTCM) is a collaboration between NUS and the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University. Singapore's first conservatory of music, YSTCM was founded as the Singapore Conservatory of Music in 2001. The School was renamed Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music in recognition of a gift from the family of the late Dr Yong Loo Lin in memory of his daughter.[citation needed]Public HealthThe Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health is Singapore's first and only tertiary education institution for public health.[47] It traces its beginnings to the University of Malaya's Department of Social Medicine and Public Health, formed in 1948.[48] The school collaborates with partners including the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Harvard School of Public Health and University of Michigan School of Public Health.[47]Public PolicyMain article: Lee Kuan Yew School of Public PolicyThe Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy was formally established in 2004 as an autonomous graduate school of NUS. Although the School was formally launched in 2004, it inherited NUS' Public Policy Programme, which was established in 1992 in partnership with Harvard University's John F Kennedy School of Government.ScienceThe Faculty of Science comprises the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Food Science & Technology, Mathematics, Pharmacy, Physics, and Statistics & Applied Probability and offers degree programmes in Chemistry, Computational Biology, Data Science & Analytics, Environmental Studies (Environmental Biology), Food Science & Technology, Life Sciences, Mathematics/Applied Mathematics, Pharmaceutical Science, Pharmacy, Physics, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics. The first female Dean of the Faculty of Science was Gloria Lim, who was appointed in 1973. She served a four-year term and was reappointed in 1979, but resigned after one year to allow Koh Lip Lin to continue his post. In 1980, University of Singapore merged with Nanyang University to form NUS, resulting in overlapping posts.[49]University Scholars ProgrammeThe University Scholars Programme (USP) is an undergraduate academic programme established in 2001 in NUS. Each year, USP admits around 200 undergraduates from across seven faculties and schools in NUS.The USP education focuses on strengthening core academic and professional skills – writing and critical thinking, analytical and quantitative reasoning, the ability to ask the right questions and pursue research, and the habit of reflecting upon ideas within a broad intellectual landscape. This is done through an intensive and rigorous multi-disciplinary curriculum, and a rich offering of local and international programmes. USP's focus on core skills complements the students' strengths in their major disciplines, enabling them to make substantial connections across fields, enhancing their intellectual depth and breadth.USP students reside in Cinnamon College at the NUS University Town. Alongside a vibrant student life, the residential college is a space for discussions on diverse issues, allowing students to develop meaningful engagement with real-world matters.Yale-NUS CollegeMain article: Yale-NUS CollegeThe Yale-NUS College is a liberal arts college in Singapore which opened in August 2013 as a joint project of Yale University and the National University of Singapore. It exists as an autonomous college within NUS, allowing it greater freedom to develop its own policies while tapping on the existing facilities and resources of the main university.[50] Students who graduate receive a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) or a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree from Yale-NUS College awarded by NUS.[50]Pericles Lewis, a former professor at Yale, was appointed as the founding president in 2012.[51][52][53][54]Teaching centresNUS High School of Mathematics and Science CampusNUS has a variety of teaching centres including:Centre for Development of Teaching and Learning (CDTL), which is the NUS academic development unit and in that capacity seeks to support teaching so as to improve student learning.Centre for Instructional Technology (CIT), which provides for the exploration, development and application of digital and audio-visual technologies to support and enhance teaching and learning. This is done through the NUS-developed Integrated Virtual Learning Environment and by developing new applications/services and incorporating multimedia content in courses for academia.[55]Centre for English Language Communication (CELC).Institute of Systems Science (ISS), which offers professional information technology continuing education to managers and IT practitioners.Centre for Teaching and Learning CTL at Yale-NUS College supports academic development in the distinctive pedagogy of liberal arts education. Efforts focus in many areas, but especially in team-based learning, student-centred learning, grading and assessment, effective classroom discussion, impactful feedback, and intercultural engagement for all the divisions - Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities.NUS High School of Mathematics and ScienceMain article: NUS High School of Mathematics and ScienceNUS High School of Mathematics and Science is a school specialising in mathematics and science, and provides secondary and pre-tertiary education to many students with an inclination to these fields.ResearchAmong the major research focuses at NUS are biomedical and life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials science and engineering, infocommunication and infotechnology, humanities and social sciences, and defence-related research.One of several niche research areas of strategic importance to Singapore being undertaken at NUS is bioengineering. Initiatives in this area include bioimaging, tissue engineering and tissue modulation. Another new field which holds much promise is nanoscience and nanotechnology. Apart from higher-performance but lower-maintenance materials for manufacturing, defence, transportation, space and environmental applications, this field also heralds the development of accelerated biotechnical applications in medicine, health care and agriculture.[citation needed]Research institutes and centresCurrently, NUS hosts 21 university-level research institutes and centres (RICs) in various fields such as research on Asia, risk management, logistics, engineering sciences, mathematical sciences, biomedical and life sciences, nanotechnology to marine studies. Besides that, NUS also hosts three Research Centres of Excellence, namely, the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Centre for Quantum Technologies and Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore – a partner in Singapore's fifth Research Centre of Excellence. Besides university-level RICs, NUS also has close affiliation with many national research centres and institutes.[56] A special mention is required for The Logistics Institute – Asia Pacific, which is a collaborative effort between NUS and the Georgia Institute of Technology for research and education programmes in logistics.[57] NUS announced its most recent research institute, the Next Age Institute, a partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, in February 2015.[58]Major research facilitiesComparative Medicine was set up to provide professional and technical service for laboratory animal care, veterinary medical services, and animal research project support for NUS staff and students.National University Medical Institutes focuses its efforts on the development of centralised research facilities and services for the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS and developing research programmes in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.[60]EntrepreneurshipNUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NUS Enterprise is the entrepreneurial arm of NUS. Its activities are organised into 4 areas, including a business incubator,[61] entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurship outreach and technology commercialisation.The NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme was started in 2001, giving students the opportunity to experience, live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub. Participants of the programme either spend 6 months or a year overseas, taking courses at partner universities and working in start-ups.[62] The program is offered at twelve different locations: Silicon Valley and New York in the United States, Toronto in Canada, Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China, Stockholm in Sweden, Munich in Germany, Lausanne in Switzerland, Israel, Singapore and Southeast Asia (Jakarta and Vietnam).The NUS Industry Liaison Office (ILO) is another department that is involved in the creation of deep tech start-ups. It manages the University's technology transfer and promotes research collaborations with industry and partners. ILO manages NUS intellectual property, commercialises its intellectual assets and facilitates the spinning off of technologies into start-up companies.[63]Campus facilities and resourcesIT and computing servicesThe IT facilities and network are generally provided by its central IT department, Computer Centre. NUSNET is used in research, teaching, learning and administration. In 2004, a campus-wide grid computing network based on UD Grid MP was deployed, connecting at least 1,000 computers. This becomes one of the largest such virtual supercomputing facilities in the region.[64]NUS used Internet2 technology to make distance learning possible. Students from Singapore and Massachusetts Institute of Technology were able to learn and interact in one virtual classroom.[65]Library servicesThe NUS Libraries comprises 8 libraries, namely, the Central Library, Chinese Library, CJ Koh Law Library, Hon Sui Sen Memorial Library, the Medical Library, Music Library, Science Library and East Asian Institute Library. Its primary clients are NUS and NUS-affiliated research institutes, students, teaching faculty, research and administrative staff members, as well as a sizeable group of external members. Its collection encompasses subjects in architecture, building and real estate, business, dentistry, engineering, computer science, the humanities and social sciences, law, medicine, music, nursing and science. As of June 2017, there are 2,354,741 unique titles, and 26,074 microform resources[66] in the collection.[67]NUS University TownThe NUS University Town (UTown) opened in August 2011. Located across the NUS Kent Ridge campus, it was built on the site of a former golf course.[68] This is where 2,400 undergraduate students, 1,700 graduate students and 1,000 researchers work, live, and learn in close proximity. There are four residential colleges: Cinnamon College, Tembusu College, College of Alice & Peter Tan, and Residential College 4 – initially named Cinnamon, Tembusu, Angsana and Khaya, respectively. An Education Resource Centre, the Stephen Riady Centre and a Graduate Residence are also located here.[69]AccessibilityThere are several internal shuttle buses that run throughout NUS: A1, A2, D1, D2, B1, B2, C, BTC1, BTC2, A1E, A2E, and AV1. Information on bus routes can be found in the NUS NextBus app. The Kent Ridge campus can be accessed by taking a shuttle bus from the Kent Ridge MRT station (CC24). The Bukit Timah campus is located close to the Botanic Gardens MRT station (CC19).Student accommodationNUS has three types of student accommodation: Halls of residence; Student residences; and Residential colleges. There are about 6,000 residential places distributed between Halls of Residence and Student Residences on campus, in addition to around 4,100 students who live in the residential colleges and graduate residences at University Town.[70] There are free Internal Shuttle Buses that ply the entire campus seven days a week.[71]Halls of residenceNUS has 7 Halls of Residence with about 3,000 residential places. Halls have their own interest groups and regular student productions, in addition to university-wide student co-curricular activities. Halls compete with each other in the Inter-Hall Games.The Halls of Residence are:[72]Eusoff Hall (345 single rooms; 70 double rooms)Kent Ridge Hall (507 single)King Edward VII Hall (350 single; 60 double)Raffles Hall (213 single; 128 double)Sheares Hall (509 single)Temasek Hall (345 single; 70 double)Prince George's Park House (626 single)Student residencesNUS also has 3 Student Residences for undergraduate students with clusters of 11 to 15 single rooms with their own kitchen and bathroom facilities. Kitchen and dining areas are equipped with basic cooking appliances. The NUS University Town houses the Graduate Residence for graduate students with the option of both apartments and single rooms.[73] Residences generally do not have co-curricular activities.The Student Residences are:[74]Kuok Foundation HousePrince George's Park ResidencesGraduate ResidencesResidential collegesThe more recent residential developments at NUS are residential colleges, modeled after the residential college systems of universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. Like halls, residential colleges have unique co-curricular activities. Residential colleges also have their own academic programmes, with general education (GE) requirements different from each other and from the rest of the University. The academic programmes in residential colleges take place in small-sized seminar classes.Cinnamon CollegeCinnamon College houses the University Scholars Programme (USP). Around 620 students live in the USP residential college, which contains the administrative and faculty offices for USP as well as teaching classrooms.USP students take modules at the college and follow the current USP curriculum. They are required to take eight multi-disciplinary modules specially designed for USP students, including Writing and Critical Thinking, Quantitative Reasoning Foundation, and the University Scholars Seminar. Students have various options to fulfil their USP advanced curriculum requirements that include individual research with faculty mentors, and industrial and entrepreneurial attachments.[75]Tembusu CollegeTembusu College is one of the first two Residential Colleges in NUS University Town, an extension to the main NUS campus at Kent Ridge. Tembusu houses mainly undergraduates, in addition to resident faculty, distinguished visiting scholars and a few graduate fellows.The college offers five multi-disciplinary modules fulfilling the "University-Level Requirements" (2 General Education modules, 2 Breadth modules, and 1 Singapore Studies module) which most NUS undergraduates must read to graduate. Students read the rest of their modules in their home faculties. A University Town Residential Programme Certificate is issued to eligible students, along with the regular degree scroll. Students from non-modular faculties (i.e. Law, Medicine and Dentistry) also belong to the college, but with coursework tailored to their specific programmes.[citation needed] The Rector of Tembusu College is Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large and former United Nations Ambassador Tommy Koh, who is also the former Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law.College of Alice & Peter TanThe College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) is a Residential College for all NUS undergraduates. In addition to providing a two-year academic programme (the University Town College Programme), CAPT is distinguished by the vision of helping students engage with the community within and outside of NUS. It consciously weaves the theme of active citizenship and community engagement through its curriculum and other aspects of the student experience.Residential College 4Residential College 4 (RC4) is the newest Residential College in NUS University Town to offer the University Town College Programme (UTCP). RC4 believes in catalysing a generation of systems citizens in Singapore by employing systems thinking and systems dynamic modelling to elicit mental models to emulate the complexity of the problems around us – such as population dynamics, diseases and healthcare.Recent events and highlights of RC4 included the holding of the 2nd Asia-Pacific System Dynamics Conference 2017, RC4 Arts Night 2017: P.U.L.S.E, Cognitio Teas with various experts of varying fields, Rector's Tea, as well as volunteering events such as Popiah Making with Senior Citizens @ Lions Befrienders (Clementi) and DroneLive@UTown. More information about the college can be found at NUS RC4Ridge View Residential CollegeRidge View Residential College (RVRC) was formally established in April 2014, housed in the former Ridge View Residences. It is the only residential college that is situated outside University Town. The low-rise interconnected buildings are nestled against the backdrop of the Kent Ridge Forest, visually distinct with their brick-clad exteriors, open courtyards and heritage trees. The site was the former location for Kent Ridge Hall until November 2002. As the college program gradually evolved and the student community grew, construction began in November 2015 for a new building to complement the needs of the college. The new Annex building became operational in March 2017.List of principal officersThe following table is a list of the principal officers of the National University of Singapore's predecessors.

Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation.
