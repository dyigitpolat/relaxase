The National University of Singapore (NUS) is the national research university of Singapore. Founded in 1905 as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School, NUS is the oldest higher education institution in Singapore. It is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world and is considered to be the best university in the Asia-Pacific.[5][6] NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences, medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business, computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.NUS's main campus is located in the southwestern part of Singapore, adjacent to Kent Ridge, accommodating an area of 150 ha (0.58 sq mi);[7] the Duke-NUS Medical School, a postgraduate medical school jointly established with Duke University,[8] is located at the Outram campus; its Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; the Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts college established in collaboration with Yale University,[9] is located at University Town (commonly known as UTown). NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.

NUS has one Nobel Laureate, Konstantin Novoselov, among its faculty.HistoryIn September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities to petition the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[10] It was noted by Anderson that there were other petitions prior which were not successfully due to concerns over having sufficient number of students and support from the local community.[11] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise 87,077 Straits dollars from the community, of which containing a personal donation of $12,000.[11][12][13] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School. At Anderson's directions, the school was hosted temporarily at a recently emptied block at a Government-run asylum in Pasir Panjang while providing the staff required to run the school.[11]In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.In 1928,[14] Raffles College, a separate institution from the medical school, was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.University of Malaya (1949–1962)In 1949, Raffles College was merged with King Edward VII College of Medicine to form University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Wong Poh Kam[17] and its activities are organised into four areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development and entrepreneurship research.NUS has 17 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram.EducationNUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) on top of regular two-hour lectures, and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law. At the start of every semester, students are allocated a set number of points with which they use to bid for enrollment to their module of choice. NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a music conservatory.NUS offers many programmes for student enrichment, with one of these being the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).[18] Students are expected to spend several hours each week on their projects during the semester, and to work full-time on them during the vacation. UROP is offered in the following Faculties/Schools/Residential College: Arts & Social Sciences, Computing, Dentistry, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, University Scholars Programme, and Tembusu College. As every Faculty handles their UROP application slightly different, more information should be sought from the respective faculty.University rankingsNUS is ranked 1st in Singapore & Asia Pacific, and 22nd in the world according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[21] and 11th in the world according to the 2018 QS World University Rankings.[26] NUS was named the world's 4th most international university.[27] In the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018, an annual ranking of university graduates' employability, NUS was ranked 30th in the world.[28]The QS World University Rankings 2021 ranked NUS 11th in the world and 1st in Asia.[23] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021 placed NUS at 25th in the world and 3rd in Asia Pacific,[21] while it is placed at 24th in the 2019 reputation rankings.[29] In 2020, it is ranked 29th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[30]Faculties and schoolsArts and Social SciencesFASS majors are organized into three divisions: Asian Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences.[31]Undergraduate degrees include the Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Arts with Honours (BA (Hons)) and Bachelor of Social Sciences with Honours (BSocSci (Hons)).[32]BusinessMain article: NUS Business SchoolThe NUS Business School was founded as the Department of Business Administration in 1965.
