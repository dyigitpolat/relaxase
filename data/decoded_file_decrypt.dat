The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.The growth of University of Malaya was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.Nanyang University (1955-1980)Main article: Nanyang UniversityIn 1955, Nanyang University (abbreviated Nantah, 南大) was established on the backdrop of the Chinese community in Singapore.[7]University of Singapore (1962–1980)In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[10] Legislation was passed in 1961, establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya, while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.Present formThe National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University on 6 August 1980.[15] This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity and promote English as Singapore's main language of education. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[16]NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988.
